ID-12 schematics, originally uploaded by hc gilje.

(This schematic has been updated with a 1k resistor between pin 10 and LED after reports by users)

If you are using the breakout board from sparkfun, the pinout is as seen in the image below.
Connect the led+resistor to pin 10, serial connection to pin 9, ground to pins 1 and 7, +5v to pins 2 and 11 (updated june 26th, 2008 )
